# Movie Recommender System

A collaborative-filtering movie recommender built end to end: from-scratch
matrix factorization, a FastAPI serving layer, a Streamlit frontend, automated
testing and CI.

🚧 **Work in progress.** This README grows as each component lands.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # runtime + test dependencies

python src/generate_sample_data.py    # writes data/raw/*.csv
pytest
```

## Data

The project builds against a **schema-accurate synthetic sample** matching the
MovieLens 100K format — 200 users, 300 movies, 15,000 ratings — so the pipeline
can be developed and tested without depending on an external download.

`data/raw/*.csv` is gitignored: it is regenerable output, not source. Run the
generator after cloning.

**This is not the real dataset.** Before publishing any results, swap in the
real MovieLens 100K data:

Movie popularity follows a Zipf-like distribution — a few titles get rated
heavily, most rarely — because a flat distribution would make the planned
popularity-bias audit meaningless.

## Planned

- [x] Sample data generator
- [ ] Popularity baseline + matrix factorization model
- [ ] Evaluation metrics and popularity-bias audit
- [ ] FastAPI serving layer
- [ ] Streamlit frontend
- [ ] Containerization and CI
